## Starting out decently

It is one thing to get pretty widgets to display on an emulator, however it is another
to design with production in mind. I am talking about separating things so
 the app can easily grow without being cumbersome.
 
- State is handled with MultiProvider at the top level
- Code is structured under sensible directories - this is a work-in-progress, but this is a decent start
- This will be a starter project only so we are keeping it light and easy to grok
